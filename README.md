# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction
Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham,Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patient's information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

****
**Conclusion :**

**1.** In the given dataset we observe that Coronary heart disease increases from age 51 to 67 then decreases.

**2.** We draw the countplot and observe that no. of male heart patients is more than female and also notice that male get early age heart diseases as compared to females.

**3.** We draw the barplot  and observe that no. of cigsperday taken by male is more than female.So, male heart patients is more as compared to females.

**4.** We draw the boxplot and observe that female BMI(The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m²) is more than male BMI. that’s leads to OVERWEIGHT and So,female CHD patients is  more than male CHD patients.

**5.** We also observe that male heart disease patients has more glucose level as compared to female heart disease patients.
